Anemia is defined as a low number of red blood cells. In a routine blood test, anemia is reported as a low hemoglobin or
hematocrit. Hemoglobin is the main protein in your red blood cells. It carries oxygen, and delivers it throughout your
body. If you have anemia, your hemoglobin level will be low too. If it is low enough, your tissues or organs may not get
enough oxygen. Symptoms of anemia -- like fatigue or shortness of breath -- happen because your organs aren't getting
what they need to work the way they should. 
Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the haemoglobin concentration within them is
lower than normal.
The most common causes of anaemia include nutritional deficiencies, particularly iron deficiency, though
deficiencies in folate, vitamins B12 and A are also important causes.
Haemoglobin is needed to carry oxygen and if you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or not enough
haemoglobin, there will be a decreased capacity of the blood to carry oxygen to the body’s tissue.
For proper treatment, knowing the type of anemia the patient is suffering from is really important.
There are mainly 3 types in which anemia can be divided into - Microcytosis (low MCV), Macrocytosis (high
MCV) and Normocytic (normal MCV). Under these 3 types, we can zoom in into the cause of anemia..
Anemia is the most common blood condition in the U.S. It affects almost 6% of the population. Women, young children, and
people with long-term diseases are more likely to have anemia. Important things to remember are:

Certain forms of anemia are passed down through your genes, and infants may have it from birth.
Women are at risk of iron-deficiency anemia because of blood loss from their periods and higher blood supply demands
during pregnancy.
Older adults have a greater risk of anemia because they are more likely to have kidney disease or other chronic medical
conditions.</pre>

The signs of anemia can be so mild that you might not even notice them. At a certain point, as your blood cells
decrease, symptoms often develop. Depending on the cause of the anemia, symptoms may include:

    1. Dizziness, lightheadness, or feeling like you are about to pass out
    2. Fast or unusual heartbeat
    3. Headache
    4. Pain, including in your bones, chest, belly, and joints
    5. Problems with growth, for children and teens
    6. Shortness of breath
    7. Skin that’s pale or yellow
    8. Cold hands and feet
    9. Tiredness or weakness

When someone develops anemia, they’re said to be anemic, meaning they have symptoms of anemia, like being very tired or
feeling cold all of the time. Anemia affects different people in different ways:

    1. Newborns: Some infants are born with low red blood cell counts. Most newborns don’t need medical treatment for anemia,
       but some with severe anemia may need blood transfusions.
       
    2. Infants: Infants may get less iron than they need when they start eating solid food. That’s because the iron in solid
       food isn’t absorbed as easily as iron in breast milk or formula. Infants with anemia may appear lethargic.

    3. Children: Children do a lot of growing between birth and age 2. Children going through growth spurts need more iron.
       Children with anemia may develop related problems such as delayed development of motor skills and issues with learning.

    4. Women who are pregnant: Women who are pregnant may develop iron-deficiency anemia, which may increase the chance of
       complications such as premature birth or giving birth to babies with low birth weight.

    5. Women and people designated female at birth (DFAB): Women and people DFAB who have heavy periods (menstrual bleeding) or
       conditions like uterine fibroids may lose blood and develop anemia.

    6. People age 65 and older: People over 65 are more likely to have iron-poor diets and certain chronic diseases that
       increase their risk of developing anemia. If they develop anemia, they may have heart conditions or weakness that makes
       it hard for them to get around. They may have confusion or depression.

    7. People with chronic conditions: Some chronic conditions like autoimmune diseases or cancer may increase the risk of
       anemia. This is anemia of chronic disease.

    Different types of anemia have different causes. They include:
    
    Iron deficiency anemia. This most common type of anemia is caused by a shortage of iron in your body. Your bone marrow
    needs iron to make hemoglobin. Without adequate iron, your body can't produce enough hemoglobin for red blood cells.
    
    Without iron supplementation, this type of anemia occurs in many pregnant women. It's also caused by blood loss, such as
    from heavy menstrual bleeding; an ulcer in the stomach or small bowel; cancer of the large bowel; and regular use of
    some pain relievers that are available without a prescription, especially aspirin, which can cause inflammation of the
    stomach lining resulting in blood loss. It's important to determine the source of iron deficiency to prevent recurrence
    of the anemia.
    
    Vitamin deficiency anemia. Besides iron, your body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to produce enough healthy red blood
    cells. A diet lacking in these and other key nutrients can cause decreased red blood cell production. Some people who
    consume enough B-12 aren't able to absorb the vitamin. This can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia, also known as
    pernicious anemia.

    Anemia of inflammation. Certain diseases — such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, Crohn's
    disease and other acute or chronic inflammatory diseases — can interfere with the production of red blood cells.

    Aplastic anemia. This rare, life-threatening anemia occurs when your body doesn't produce enough red blood cells. Causes
    of aplastic anemia include infections, certain medicines, autoimmune diseases and exposure to toxic chemicals.
    Anemias associated with bone marrow disease. A variety of diseases, such as leukemia and myelofibrosis, can cause anemia
    by affecting blood production in your bone marrow. The effects of these types of cancer and cancer-like disorders vary
    from mild to life-threatening.

    Hemolytic anemias. This group of anemias develops when red blood cells are destroyed faster than bone marrow can replace
    them. Certain blood diseases increase red blood cell destruction. You can inherit a hemolytic anemia, or you can develop
    it later in life.

    Sickle cell anemia. This inherited and sometimes serious condition is a hemolytic anemia. It's caused by a defective
    form of hemoglobin that forces red blood cells to assume an abnormal crescent (sickle) shape. These irregular blood
    cells die prematurely, resulting in a chronic shortage of red blood cells.

A diagnosis of anemia begins with both your health history and your family health history, along with a physical exam.

WHO's Hemoglobin thresholds used to define anemia[61] (1 g/dL = 0.6206 mmol/L)

    Age or gender group             Hb threshold (g/dL)     Hb threshold (mmol/L)
    Children (0.5–5.0 yrs)              11.0                        6.8
    Children (5–12 yrs)                 11.5                        7.1
    Teens (12–15 yrs)                   12.0                        7.4
    Women, non-pregnant (>15yrs)        12.0                        7.4
    Women, pregnant                     11.0                        6.8
    Men (>15yrs)                        13.0                        8.1

A family history of certain types of anemia such as sickle cell disease can be helpful. A history of exposure to toxic
agents in the home or workplace might point to an environmental cause.

Laboratory tests are most often used to diagnose anemia. Some examples of tests that your doctor may order include:

Complete blood count (CBC). The CBC blood test measures your hemoglobin levels and can show the number and size of red
blood cells. It can also indicate if levels of other blood cells like white blood cells and platelets are normal.

Reticulocyte count. A reticulocyte count is a blood test that measures levels of immature red blood cells called
reticulocytes. It can help your doctor determine if your bone marrow is producing enough new red blood cells.

Serum iron levels. A serum iron test is a blood test that measures the total amount of iron in your blood. It can show
if iron deficiency is the cause of anemia.

Ferritin test. A ferritin test is a blood test that analyzes iron stores in your body.
Vitamin B12 test. The vitamin B12 test is a blood test that measures your vitamin B12 levels and helps your doctor
determine if these levels are too low.

Folic acid test. A folic acid test is a blood test that measures your folate levels and can indicate if this level is
too low.
Coombs test. The Coombs test is a blood test that looks for the presence of autoantibodies that are targeting and
destroying your own red blood cells.

Fecal occult blood test. This test applies a chemical to a stool specimen to see if blood is present. If the test is
positive, it means that blood is being lost somewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. Health conditions like stomach
ulcers, ulcerative colitis, and colon cancer can cause blood in stool.

Bone marrow tests. Testing of a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy can help your doctor see if your bone marrow is
functioning normally. These types of tests can be very helpful if conditions like leukemia, multiple myeloma, or
aplastic anemia are suspected.

If left untreated, anemia can go on to cause potentially serious complications. These can include:

    heart problems, such as:
        angina
        arrhythmias
        enlarged heart
        heart failure
        heart attack

    peripheral nerve damage

    restless leg syndrome

    depression

    problems with memory

    confusion

    a weakened immune system, which can lead to more frequent infections

    pregnancy complications like premature birth or low birth weight
    developmental delays in children

    multi-organ failure, which can result in death

    To avoid potential complications, it’s important to see your doctor if you develop signs or symptoms of anemia. In many
    situations, anemia can be easily treated.

    Leafy greens, especially dark ones, are among the best sources of nonheme iron. 
    They include:
        spinach
        kale
        collard greens
        dandelion greens
        Swiss chard

    Some leafy greens such as Swiss chard and collard greens also contain folate. A diet low in folate may cause folate
    deficiency anemia. Citrus fruits, beans, and whole grains are good sources of folate.
    
    When eating dark, leafy greens for iron, there’s a catch. Some greens high in iron, such as spinach and kale, are also
    high in oxalates. Oxalates can bind with iron, preventing the absorption of nonheme iron.
    
    So while it’s beneficial to eat your greens as part of an overall anemia diet, don’t depend on them solely to treat the
    condition.
    
    Vitamin C helps your stomach absorb iron. Eating leafy greens with foods that contain vitamin C such as oranges, red
    peppers, and strawberries may increase iron absorption. Some greens are good sources of both iron and vitamin C, such as
    collard greens and Swiss chard.

<pre>
All meat and poultry contain heme iron. Red meat, lamb, and venison are the best sources. Poultry and chicken have lower
amounts.

Eating meat or poultry with nonheme iron foods, such as leafy greens, along with a vitamin C-rich fruit can increase
iron absorption.

Many people shy away from organ meats, but they’re a great source of iron.

Liver is arguably the most popular organ meat. It’s rich in iron and folate. Some other iron-rich organ meats are heart,
kidney, and beef tongue.

                                </div>
                                <div class="tab-pane fade" id="tabs-1-4">
<pre>
Some seafood provides heme iron. Shellfish such as oysters, clams, scallops, crabs, and shrimp are good sources. Most
fish contain iron.

Fish with the best levels of iron include:

    canned or fresh tuna
    mackerel
    mahi mahi
    pompano
    fresh perch
    fresh or canned salmon

Although canned sardines are good sources of iron, they’re also high in calcium.

Calcium may bind with iron and reduces its absorption. Foods high in calcium shouldn’t be eaten at the same time as
iron-rich foods.

Other examples of calcium-rich foods include:

    dairy milk
    fortified plant milks
    yogurt
    kefir
    cheese
    tofu

<pre>
Many foods are fortified with iron. Add these foods to your diet if you’re a vegetarian or struggle to eat other sources
of iron:

    fortified orange juice
    fortified ready-to-eat cereals
    foods made from fortified refined flour such as white bread
    fortified pasta
    foods made from fortified cornmeal

Many types of nuts and seeds are good sources of iron. They taste great on their own or sprinkled on salads or yogurt.

Some nuts and seeds that contain iron are:

    pumpkin seeds
    cashews
    pistachios
    hemp seeds
    pine nuts
    sunflower seeds
    Find raw pumpkin seeds, raw cashews, and raw pine nuts online.

    Both raw and roasted nuts have similar amounts of iron.

    Almonds are also a good source of iron. They’re great as part of a healthy eating plan, but since they’re also high in
    calcium, they may not increase your iron levels that much.
